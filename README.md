# Machine-Learning-Basics
Basics of machine learning with linear and logistic regression

Hi guys! This is my first repository and it deals with the 2 most basic models of machine learning- Linear and Logistic Regression.

First things first, you need to setup an environment on your pc to implement or test this models, which is a python enviornment.
Note- the current notebooks are written in python 2, so I would insist that you use python 2 for it, but they will work with python 3 with some minor changes.

Now, to setup your own environment to get started with machine learning, please visit my project posted on hackster. The link is given below:


Now that you have your environment ready, you need the following libraries to run this project :

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib

That's it, this is all you need to know for the basics! 

Enjoy and comment if you have any doubts. :)
